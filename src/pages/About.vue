        <div class="page-content">
          <p>
            Be sure to know that you're invited here on an initial release, fresh from
            our design process with rapid implementation, and that the same
            is likely true of the Design Documents you'll find and may use. </p>
          <p>In the present Covid circumstances, we've felt it's best
            to get what is useful out to be seen, into public view.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simple-to-use Finder in this app will help you discover designs,
            by trying words that suggest your interest. You'll then see candidate cards,
            each with an image and a brief description to help you get an idea about it.</p>
          <p>
            Tapping on a card will bring up the Viewer on that design,
            where you'll have a quick Summary, and then be ready to tap or click again,
            into easy reading details over all Design visuals and text Documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Design Documents will usually include a link to visit the originators
            own website, where you may download all the design's materials, which
            usually include 3D Printing machine instructions, and often CAD files.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a tablet or phone, you can just swipe left or right, in the usual way,
            to move rapidly through what's available -- or if you prefer, tap the
            arrow buttons that appear. On a laptop or other larger computer, you also can
            use your keyboard arrow buttons, to scroll right or left in a similar way.
          </p>
          <p>Being able to scan through designs means you'll be able
            to rapidly appreciate what the built result is actually going to be like,
            which should help in coming to important judgements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speed and ease, across culture, situations, and needs, are the goals we
            are after, to make this application most useful for you.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting, and we hope what you find can be useful.</p>

          <h3>We ask you to kindly read our Cautionary Statement:</h3>
          <p>
            Please be careful to note, that while building with 3D Printing can be fun
            and interesting certainly, medical equipment is a serious undertaking.</p>

          <p>We encourage you to take all care and caution to heart, and to work directly
            with the medical staff who will use what you make.</p>

          <p>A medical ventilator, for example, can be priceless when it is needed, but
            it is also potentially <i>very dangerous to the patient</i> if not mechanically precise,
            or if it is not set up and consistently monitored for them, with the care that
            only persons who have full medical skills and training in its use can give.</p>

          <p>The documents of the MIT Emergency Ventilator that you find here describes
            very well these concerns for its own case, and will also give you a
            good idea of what similar cautions and considerations you should look for,
            should actively seek out, for any of the designs.</p>

          <p>Please be as aware and concerned also for where a given design may be
          safe or effective in its use, as in the cautions that face shields mention.</p>

          <p>You'll see why you'll want and will need to get best and constant advice
            of those medical persons who will actually use your results, and
            according to conditions in the situation where you may wish to build them.</p>

          <p>It's our intention to become as useful as possible on capabilities
            and concerns, while you can see that the responsibility must remain
            with you who use the designs. You must do so properly and with
            informed due care, so that the best can come of your efforts,
            providing for others through making medical equipment.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

    This is the fix for universal offset problems with fixed menu bars

    https://css-tricks.com/hash-tag-links-padding/#article-header-id-1

    It needs to be used on every page that can be called through anchors,
