- If you want to focus on formating and compiling documentation [go here](https://github.com/CombatCovid/SPA-website/wiki/Getting-started)
- Take over a feature in the issues
- Open a new issue

**Technology stack**: GraphQL, Apollo, Vuejs, Gridsome

## Why doing this and what is the problem ?
Around the world many initiatives are poping up to mitigate the shortage of equipment and accesories to treat covid19.
Many designs and groups working on them have been released in various ways and formats. This has been happening through different channels, websites. Here is a [**list of initiatives**](https://openhardware4.me/open-hardware-leaders.github.io/covid19.html).

**The problem we are trying to solve**: The designs(data) being generated is not easy to find, is in different languages, and when it scales to many people participating it becomes a maze of content. Currently the formats, channels and threads are difficult to follow and understand due to the urgency of the moment. We would like to help to improve the process of finding, deciding, replicating and deploying these equipments. 

## What we want to do with this solution
- Improve accessibility of the current designs
- Make easy for contributors to generate replication guides and protocols
  - Experts and lead engineers should be guiding on how to replicate and test this equipment
- Internationalize the documentation with different languages
- Help people connect locally on a peer to peer level
- Capture all the relevant information to facilitate the workgroups which includes:
  - Replication/ build logs
  - Number of succesful replications of the equipment
  - Contact experts available locally
  - Contact makers or facilities available to manufacture a design

## Help wanted for development
Experienced with Gridsome is a plus!!
- [x] Designer(s) with frontend backend experience
- [ ] Backend developer(s) with expertise in GraphQL and apollo
- [ ] Frontend developer(s) experienced with Vuejs and apollo
- [ ] Lead engineers and developers currently working on initiatives that provide minimum structure of equipment documentation
- [ ] People that want to help out with translation and documentation


## Fastrack approach to facilitate design accesibility (1-2 weeks)
- Work with gridsome
- Present list of projects with images and stars in github.
- Use current github platform to capture repos
  - Invite project leads to generate a folder call `docs` containing files in numeric order we could capture those files in the repositories. If people want to do it with different languages the folder could have subfolders with specific notation EN/ES/NL..
- Present other relevant metadata that is relevant for this context (designs that are clinically validated, etc.)
