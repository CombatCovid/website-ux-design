# Why Combat Covid with hardware? 
Around the world many initiatives are poping up to mitigate the shortage of equipment and accesories to treat covid19.
Many designs and groups working on them have been released in various ways and formats. This has been happening through different channels, websites. Here is a [**list of initiatives**](https://openhardware4.me/open-hardware-leaders.github.io/covid19.html).

**The problem we are trying to solve**: The designs(data) being generated is not easy to find, is in different languages, and when it scales to many people participating it becomes a maze of content. Currently the formats, channels and threads are difficult to follow and understand due to the urgency of the moment. We would like to help to improve the process of finding, deciding upon, replicating and deploying these equipments. 

## How it works
 We use github to publish content, and git to manage version control. We also have a chat where people contributing can ask questions

## What we want to do with this solution
- Improve accessibility of the current designs
- Make easy for contributors to generate replication guides and protocols
  - Experts and lead engineers should be guiding on how to replicate and test this equipment
- Internationalize the documentation with different languages
