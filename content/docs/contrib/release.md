# Release notes
## Core features
- **Finder**: allows to quickly search for design using advanced text recognition.
- **Viewer**: presents design documents and images as well as links to the repositories to download the source. The source files are hosted in a repository.
## Tips to make the best out of CombatCovid
### Use the finder and search feature to search for designs
The simple-to-use Finder in this app will help you discover designs, by trying words that suggest your interest. You'll then see candidate cards, each with an image and a brief description to help you get an idea about it.

Tapping on a card will bring up the Viewer on that design, where you'll have a quick Summary, and then be ready to tap or click buttons for Details, into easy reading for all available Design visual Images and text Documents.

### Find the organization or workgroup that created the design in the documentation
The Design Documents will usually include a link to visit the originators own website, where you may find even more detail, and download all the design's materials, which usually include 3D Printing machine instructions, and often additional items such as CAD files.

### Use the viewer to quickly read the documents needed to replicate a piece of hardware
With a tablet or phone, you can just swipe left or right, in the usual way, to move rapidly through what's available in Details -- or if you prefer, tap the arrow buttons that appear. On a laptop or other larger computer, you also can use your keyboard arrow buttons, to scroll right or left in a similar way.

Being able to scan through designs means you'll be able to rapidly appreciate what the built result is actually going to be like, which should help in coming to important judgements.

Speed and ease, across culture, situations, and needs, are the goals we are after, to make this application most useful for you.

## Cookies Statement
We use no cookies at all. We use a small cache in persistent local browser storage to allow performance improvement, as well as possible future features like repository bookmarks.

In none of these features is any data sent at all from your browser, and we do not ask for any personal information in any case, so privacy is assured.

## We ask you to kindly read our Cautionary Statement:
Please be careful to note, that while building with 3D Printing can be fun and interesting certainly, medical equipment is a serious undertaking.

We encourage you to take all care and caution to heart, and to work directly with the medical staff who will use what you make.

A medical ventilator, for example, can be priceless when it is needed, but it is also potentially very dangerous to the patient if not mechanically precise, or if it is not set up and consistently monitored for them, with the care that only persons who have full medical skills and training in its use can give.

The documents of the MIT Emergency Ventilator that you find here describes very well these concerns for its own case, and will also give you a good idea of what similar cautions and considerations you should look for, should actively seek out, for any of the designs.

Please be as aware and concerned also for where a given design may be safe or effective in its use, as in the important cautions that Face Shields designs mention.

You'll see why you'll want, and will need to get, the best and constant advice of those medical persons who will actually use your results, according to conditions in the situation where you may wish to build them.

It's our intention to become as useful as possible on discovering capabilities and concerns, while you can see that the responsibility must remain with you who build from the designs.

You must do so properly and with informed due care, so that the best can come of your efforts, providing for others through 3D printing and constructing medical equipment.

Thank you.
